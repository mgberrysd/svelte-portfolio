I have worked with clients in
		a diverse range of industries to provide them with both modern and accessible full stack
		applications. As a developer I have project experience working with HTML, CSS,
		JavaScript/Typescript, Node.js, Express.js, React, Svelte, MySQL, MongoDB, various AWS products and a
		number of CSS frameworks. Every project that I have worked on has provided opportunities to
		further hone these skills and learn new ones in pursuit of better development and final
		products.</p> <p>My education was not originally in software development or computer science at all, but rather, in mechanical
		engineering. As a mechanical engineer I earned a MSME with an emphasis in thermofluids. I have
		several years of research experience devising and conducting tests for NASA as part of their
		spacecraft fire safety programs. I conducted novel self-directed research with infrared cameras,
		infrared thermography, and other optical techniques. Throughout my research I used MATLAB
		extensively as a scripting language for data and image analysis and control systems programming.
		My experience and education has taught me to be a strong analytical problem solver and I am
		always open and excited to learn new languages, technologies, and skills.</p></section>`);function S(o){var e=h(),a=p(e);m(a,"src",`${u??""}/assets/images/test_image.jpg`);var s=n(a,2),i=n(s,2);l(e),t(1,a,()=>r,()=>({duration:1e3})),t(1,s,()=>r,()=>({delay:1e3,duration:1e3})),t(1,i,()=>r,()=>({delay:2e3,duration:1e3})),c(o,e)}export{S as component};
